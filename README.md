# Trapping
Online browser arcade game, where you must finish first avoiding your enemy's (or your friend's) traps.

## Game process
Game is divided into 2 phases:
  * The first one is the placing traps. All players have certain amount of time (currently it is 30 seconds) to choose and place their traps on game field. Some traps are invisible and are revealed only when activated, some are visible all the time. You can use this to trick your opponents.

  * The second one is the "running" phase, when players try to survive and reach finish first. If all players die, game ends with draw.

## Main idea
The main idea was to make an authoritative server, so that no one could somehow cheat. The client here is used only for rendering data from the server.

## Current status
Minimum viable product - game is playable, but it is more like demo version.

Project is unfinished, work in progress.
